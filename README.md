# Indian Property Insurance Underwriting Tool

This Streamlit app helps property insurance underwriters assess risk at specific geographic locations across India.

## Latest Fix

* **Safe Coordinate Update**: Removed `st.experimental_rerun()` and implemented a guard-based session-state update for coordinates.
* Prevents infinite reruns and runtime errors.
* Provides clear user feedback when location is updated or unchanged.

## Features

* Interactive map centered on India with clickable property location selection
* Real-time elevation data via Open-Elevation API
* Flood risk classification based on elevation
* Urban flood risk zones for major Indian metros (Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Delhi, Bengaluru)
* Fire brigade response time estimate based on sample fire stations in India
* Nearby properties exposure risk simulation
* Downloadable PDF report summarizing underwriting risk analysis
